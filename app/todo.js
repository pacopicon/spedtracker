"todo:
1) Test Hide does not persist travelling from page to page
2) Make page initialize with all students as 'unsafe to delete'
3) Fix the width of date pickers in large window width
2) Create Self-destructing data: if last test extended End time has elapsed and computer is idle: erase all data.
3) Add User profiles, add students to user relationship
4) Add User authentication
5) Host Website and propagate it
6) Create a demo: inject tooltips and then make video to be embedded into website.
7) Put comments / ratings Feed so users and other potential stakeholders get a sense of app usefulness
