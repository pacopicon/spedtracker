## TestTrakker

* a web-app especially designed for special education teachers proctoring students with testing accommodations.

* Why this app?  It can be difficult to manage a classroom of testers taking different tests with different testing accomodations (and who sometimes start at different times).  TestTrakker does all the time math for you.  TestTrakker also documents important information like the total time that a student spent on a particular test.

* How does it work?  It's simple: (1) sign in via Facebook. (2) enter student's names (or other identifiers, TestTrakker does nothing with your data except display it to you and, if you want, your students), test names and test times.  (3) Press start to start the tests.

* You can also pause, resume and end tests with the click of a button.
